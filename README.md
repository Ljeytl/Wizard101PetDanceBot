# Wizard101_DanceBot

This script runs an image classification algorithm to detect and identify the arrows on screen, and relays it back.

## Disclaimer

Although it is against the ToS to be botting and using a third-party software, since the script does not exploit any of the internal workings of the game, combined with the lack of anti bot detections from King Isle and difficulty to catch an external bot, this program should be relatively safe to use, but use it at your own discretion.

## Usage

Download and extract the latest executable bundle in the releases [here](https://github.com/Ljeytl/Wizard101PetDanceBot/releases). When unzipping the file, I recommend you chose the `extract to petdance/` option or your current folder will be filled with files. Do not move anything, including the executable, outside the folder. However, you may create a shortcut of the executable.

## Instructions

**Note: this has not been tested on the Steam version yet.**

1. Open the game and login.
1. Set your in-game settings as follows:
   * UI Size: HUGE
   * Fullscreen: OFF
1. Ensure Your Resolution is Either (800x600) or (1200,800)
1. Go to the Pet Dance game, wait near the spiral and do not open the minigame's menu (do not press `x`).
1. Run the executable (petdance.exe), do not move it out of the folder.
1. Enter amount of games to play.

### Locations

Selecting a location adds that map to a random chance that the script will select it. For example, if you choose to play in Wizard City and Mooshu, then there is a 50% chance that the script will select either Wizard City or Mooshu.

### Snacks

Selecting a snack adds that snack choice to a random choice that the script will feed that snack to your pet (see visual below for a better explanation). If no snacks are chosen, then no snacks will the fed.

### Level Up

In the case that your pet levels up, you will have to manually force stop the program by pressing the `'q'` key.

## Saving

You can save your most recent settings by clicking the `save` button on the bottom. Note that this will override your previous save preferences. To apply the save, click on the `play` button; you do not need to have Wizard101 running or be near the minigame for the save to be successful.
